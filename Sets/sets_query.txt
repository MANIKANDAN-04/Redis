# Redis Sets Examples

# 1. Add members to a set
SADD myset "value1" "value2" "value3"
# Set becomes {"value1", "value2", "value3"}

# 2. Get all members of a set
SMEMBERS myset  # Returns {"value1", "value2", "value3"}

# 3. Check if a member exists in the set
SISMEMBER myset "value1"  # Returns 1 (true)
SISMEMBER myset "value4"  # Returns 0 (false)

# 4. Remove a member from the set
SREM myset "value2"  # Removes "value2"
# Set becomes {"value1", "value3"}

# 5. Get the number of members in a set
SCARD myset  # Returns 2 (set contains {"value1", "value3"})

# 6. Perform set union (combine two sets)
SADD myset2 "value4" "value5"
SUNION myset myset2  # Returns {"value1", "value3", "value4", "value5"}

# 7. Perform set intersection (common members between two sets)
SINTER myset myset2  # Returns {} (no common elements)

# 8. Perform set difference (members in myset but not in myset2)
SDIFF myset myset2  # Returns {"value1", "value3"}

# 9. Get a random member from the set
SRANDMEMBER myset  # Returns a random element, e.g., "value1"

# 10. Pop a random member from the set (removes it)
SPOP myset  # Removes and returns a random element, e.g., "value1"
